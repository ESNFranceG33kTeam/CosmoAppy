## Integration

In order to use this module, you need to first be connect with the galaxy to retrived information from those endpoints.

In result you will get a json with every information of the user, you can filter any role or section you want in order to connect him.

But please keep in mind that if the field `admin` is at `true` you should keep him as administrator and give him full permissions. That in order to the g33kteam be able to give you full support.

## Endpoints

The default access port of coCAS is `8181`, so after it's running you should be able to access it from : `http://127.0.0.1:8181`.

This API is callable without any authentication with `GET` call :

- Login

The default behiaviour is login, so you don't need to specify any endpoint :

```bash
curl -X GET "https://${MYSERVER}" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
```

Output : (`json`) profile object

- Logout

To logout, just call the endpoint `/logout` :

```bash
curl -X GET "https://${MYSERVER}/logout" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
```

Output : no output

By default any G33kTeam member and people with IT roles on the Galaxy are grant admin permission [see here](https://github.com/ESNFranceG33kTeam/.github/blob/main/members/galaxy.yaml) for further information and details.
